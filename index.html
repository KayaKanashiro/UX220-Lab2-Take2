    <h1><b>My Favourite Book</b></h1>
    <p><i>What Are You're Looking For Is in the Library</i> By Michiko Aoyama</p>
    <h2><b>Summary</b></h2>
    <p>The book encapsulates the stories of five loosely connected individuals who visit a community library in Tokyo in search of a solution to a problem they're facing in their lives. There's a retail worker who feels her life is becoming dull, a woman returning from maternity leave after facing demotion, and several other captivating stories of people coming from different stages and directions in life. The mysterious librarian they all encounter always seems to lead them in the right direction and inspire them to find a new passion for life. The book follows a repetitive structure of being introduced to the new character and their lives, understanding their issues, and heading to the library to find some answers. The librarian would provide them with a list of recommendations, with the last on the list always being unrelated to the topic they asked for but seemingly providing the answer they sought.</p>
    <h2><b>How I Feel About The Book</b></h2>
    <p>All in all,<i>What You Are Looking For Is in the Library</i>is a wholesome and heartwarming book full of relatable and nice characters. It provides gentle themes on finding a new meaning in life, taking care of oneself, and how a little bit of kindness can go a long way. I enjoyed this book because it encapsulates the magic and comfort of a simple place like the library. Growing up, I spent a lot of time in the library, whether that be wanting to escape into a new world temporarily, hanging out with friends, simply studying, or just enjoying the peace of a comforting place; that being said, I resonated with the peaceful and gentle nature of the book. I highly recommend this book if you also enjoy libraries or just want a comforting read!</p>
